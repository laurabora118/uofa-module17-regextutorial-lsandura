## Regex Components

With the character classes it makes it easy. If you are looking for a rhythm you can use the letter /d to match up with any numberical digit.

you could use this to search a number pattern. 123 would be /d/d/d.


There are other ways options to match with also, for instance /s can match one single space.

With this in mind youcould have a number that is like this 123 456. And with both of these components you would be able to search for them with /d/d/d/s/d/d/d

This is just two examples of character class.
