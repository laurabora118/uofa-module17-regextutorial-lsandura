      <p>This is a tutorial about computer science, for different programming languages, including javascript.
        <p>We are specifically focused on the REGEX --> regular expressions</p>

        <h1 id="explained">Regex Explained</h1>The Regex can be somewhat fun, you can make it unique</li>
        <p>In speaking language there are sounds that are patterns, regular expresssions are like this but are written patterns.
        <p>Regex takes a sequence of characters to define a pattern, uses a regular type of flow but also is generalized</p>
        <p>Pretend you want to look up a code of 3 numbers then a dash then a three numbers such as 123-456.</p>
        <p>With the regex you could do that with like this \d\d\d-d\d\d\ to find the pattern.

        <p>Can be done with just about any programming language!</p>
        <p>Can be used to search or protect!</p>
        <p>Can be used to find or define!</p>
        <p>If Santa said "ho ho ho" then the regex would be something like /dd/dd/dd</p>
        <p>It really comes from a math concept called regular sets.</p>
        <p>The concept is something that young kids learn in elementary books when they have a lesson to match shape pattern pictures</p>
